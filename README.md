# Robotic_hand

The problem we were tasked with can be found in Prarob_seminar/RoboticsPracticum_Seminar2024
The program is controlled using the app3 GUI. For computer vision to work, the `dark_yolo.mat` file is required. I was unable to include the file in the transfer due to size restrictions, but it can be added through add-ons in MATLAB. Below is a link to a presentation on how the robot works.

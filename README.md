# Robotic_hand

This project was completed as part of the curriculum at FER. A four-member team, with myself as the team leader, worked on this task, where we ranked first. The problem we were assigned can be found in Prarob_seminar/RoboticsPracticum_Seminar2024.

The program is controlled using the app3 GUI. For computer vision to function, the dark_yolo.mat file is required. I was unable to include the file in the transfer due to size restrictions, but it can be added through MATLAB add-ons. Below is a link to a presentation on how the robot works.
